## Challenge Context

> Imagine a world where the right to legal guidance is not a luxury, but an inclusive, intuitive, and digitally accessible reality. In this digital age that increasingly influences the legal sector, the imperative to create intelligent tools for effortless law comprehension and navigation has never been more urgent. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the legal field is finally primed for innovation. Switzerland, boasting its well-structured legal system, stands as fertile ground for such pioneering solutions.

## Challenge Description

> Your task is to develop a conversational AI bot designed to answer questions on Swiss private law. This bot should feature a user-friendly, engaging interface and employ a Large Language Model (LLM) combined with a vector database for generating responses. It must deliver accurate and precisely referenced answers in German, French, and English. To facilitate your work, you'll be equipped with a state-of-the-art tech stack including an LLM and a vector database as your base setup.
